Few questions that I need answers for:

# Software:

## Wifi

### Is it possible to scan for wifi networks
Yes, there is a function to scan for networks, you can see type of networks and see signal strength. See [example][https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp8266wifi/scan-examples.html]

### How can you use Wifi in both endpoint and station mode

### Is it possible to put interrupt on acceleromer

### Is it possible to get noise level from microphone without too much processing power

### How to produce sound using buzzer

### How to control buzzer volume

### How to vibrate with motor

### How to add menu system

### How to adjust backlight brightness 




# Hardware (Remember JLPCB can only make one side and SMD components only):

### Display connection - cheapest and most convinient
